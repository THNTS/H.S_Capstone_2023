 <p> Red Envelope is leading the search for an IT Associate at Upper Arlington Lutheran Church.</p>
 <p> UALC is an evangelical, Spirit-led, Lutheran church in the northwest suburbs of Columbus, Ohio. We worship in two locations with a combined weekly attendance of 1200. We are part of Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ (LCMC) and the North American Lutheran Church (NALC).</p>
 <p> We believe that we are called to be an Oasis of God’s Kingdom for a dry and thirsty world, and we know that living water is meant to be shared. We envision a future so well-watered by the love and truth and Spirit of Christ that our way of life together will be transformed and even people outside the church will say “See how they love one another,” just like Jesus said they would.</p>
 <p> Life with Jesus brings hope and healing to broken people. Outside of Christ we are drawn to mirages that make empty promises of life but leave us stuffing our mouths with sand.</p>
 <p> This vision leads us to four deeply held commitments about life together at God’s Oasis:</p>
 <ul>
  <li> Everything that we do starts with the action of God. We are a Gospel people, trusting in the work of Jesus. What we offer comes from what Jesus has done and is doing.</li>
  <li> There is a distinct community at the oasis, a family sharing life together in the way of Jesus by the power of the Spirit.</li>
  <li> An oasis is not a fortress. It doesn’t have walls. We invite people in and carry Living Water out.</li>
  <li> There is an enemy; there is a desert; there are “mirages.” We are in a battle, but we know God wins.</li>
 </ul>
 <p><b> Position Summary</b></p>
 <p> The IT Associate supports technology goals for the Information Technology department. This position reports to the Director of IT while supporting both staff and ministry leaders.</p>
 <p><b> Essential Job Functions</b></p>

       As a Technical Specialist, you help new owners get started and current ones get quick, efficient support — developing strong, positive relationships with Apple. When a customer needs assistance, you quickly assess their situation. Sometimes you take care of customers with advice or a solution on the spot, using your knowledge of current Apple technology to help with iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices. At other times, you refer customers to support team members who get them up and running again. You even provide personal training for new customers, helping them acquire the basic skills they need to get started on photo, video, and music projects. The entire store team benefits from your commitment to providing the best care for customers. By helping Apple maintain strong relationships with customers, you are instrumental to our success.
