 <p> CARGO Therapeutics is engineering best-in-class CAR T-cell therapy to overcome resistance to cancer treatment and address barriers to access so that more patients may benefit from potentially curative therapies. CARGO is on a mission to outsmart cancer by advancing a new generation of best-in-class chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. Despite advances made by commercially available autologous CARs, these treatments are curative for fewer than half of all cancer patients. In addition, far too many patients are unable to access these potentially curative therapies due to other challenges, including manufacturing, supply constraints, slow turnaround time and reimbursement hurdles. The team at CARGO is intensely focused on pursuing novel solutions to achieve better cancer treatment outcomes and experiences.</p>
 <p> Our founders are pioneers and world experts in CAR T-cell therapy, and we have built a team with experience and success developing, manufacturing, launching and commercializing oncology and cell therapy products. CARGO Therapeutics colleagues share a passion to help others thrive. We are tenacious in the relentless pursuit of our mission, and we innovate to change the game for the patients we serve.</p>
