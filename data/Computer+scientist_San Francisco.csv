 <div>
  When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, ""How do these things work? How can we trust them?""
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> People mean many different things by ""interpretability"". We're focused on 
  <b>mechanistic interpretability</b>, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. If you're unfamiliar with this type of research, you might be interested in this introductory essay, or Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits. (For a broader overview of work in this space, one of our team's alumni maintains a helpful reading list.)
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do ""biology"" or ""neuroscience"" of neural networks, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we're trying to ""reverse engineer"".
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> Some of our team's notable publications include A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits, In-context Learning and Induction Heads, and Toy Models of Superposition. This work builds on ideas from members' work prior to Anthropic such as the original circuits thread, Multimodal Neurons, Activation Atlases, and Building Blocks.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> We aim to create a solid foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our recent vision post). In the short term, this means a we focus a lot of our attention on the issue of ""superposition"" (see Toy Models of Superposition, Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent, and our May 2023 update). But this is just a stepping stone towards our goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.

 </div>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> Annual Salary</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li> The expected salary range for this position is $250k - $520k</li>
 </ul>
 <div>
  <b> Logistics</b>
 </div>
 <div>
  <b> Location-based hybrid policy:</b> Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Deadline to apply:</b> We expect to be hiring for this role intermittently, but our plan is to hire a few people in the next 2-3 months, and then will likely slow hiring while the team settles. (This opportunity was originally posted early July.)
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> US visa sponsorship: </b>We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

 <div>
  <b><br> We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</b> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Compensation and Benefits</b>*
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Equity</b> - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Benefits</b> - Benefits we offer include:
 </div>
 <ul>
  <li>Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.</li>
  <li>401(k) plan with 4% matching.</li>
  <li>21 weeks of paid parental leave.</li>
  <li>Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!</li>
  <li>Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.</li>
  <li>Fertility benefits via Carrot.</li>
  <li>Daily lunches and snacks in our office.</li>
  <li>Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.</li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <ul>
  <li><br> <i>This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.</i></li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> How we're different</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Come work with us!</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

  <b>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</b> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

  <b><br> Compensation and Benefits</b>*
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Equity</b> - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Benefits</b> - Benefits we offer include:
 </div>
 <ul>
  <li>Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.</li>
  <li>401(k) plan with 4% matching.</li>
  <li>21 weeks of paid parental leave.</li>
  <li>Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!</li>
  <li>Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.</li>
  <li>Fertility benefits via Carrot.</li>
  <li>Daily lunches and snacks in our office.</li>
  <li>Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.</li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <ul>
  <li><br> <i>This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.</i></li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> How we're different</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Come work with us!</b>
 </div>
 <div>
