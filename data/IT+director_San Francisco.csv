 <p><b> ABOUT CARGO THERAPEUTICS</b></p>
 <p> CARGO Therapeutics is engineering best-in-class CAR T-cell therapy to overcome resistance to cancer treatment and address barriers to access so that more patients may benefit from potentially curative therapies. CARGO is on a mission to outsmart cancer by advancing a new generation of best-in-class chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. Despite advances made by commercially available autologous CARs, these treatments are curative for fewer than half of all cancer patients. In addition, far too many patients are unable to access these potentially curative therapies due to other challenges, including manufacturing, supply constraints, slow turnaround time and reimbursement hurdles. The team at CARGO is intensely focused on pursuing novel solutions to achieve better cancer treatment outcomes and experiences.</p>
 <p> Our founders are pioneers and world experts in CAR T-cell therapy, and we have built a team with experience and success developing, manufacturing, launching and commercializing oncology and cell therapy products. CARGO Therapeutics colleagues share a passion to help others thrive. We are tenacious in the relentless pursuit of our mission, and we innovate to change the game for the patients we serve.</p>
 <p> Join us to help make a difference!</p>

 Business Unit Description: 
 <div>
   Here's what all the hype is about Premier Nutrition Company, LLC (PNC) is a clear leader in the convenient nutrition category and makes great-tasting food products under the brand names Premier Protein, Dymatize, and PowerBar, and is part of publicly-traded BellRing Brands (NYSE:BRBR). With its people-first culture, PNC empowers its people to create the best work of their lives alongside some truly astounding colleagues.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br> 
 </div>
 <div>
  PNC treats its people like adults with respect and trust. One of our five core values is to 
  <i>Connect &amp; Belong</i> because we bring our diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and ways of thinking to each challenge grounded in our belief that everyone should have a seat at the table and be listened to deeply. Whever makes you, you - you belong here.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br> 
 </div>
 <div>
  We strive to avoid many of the outdated processes of conventional workplaces. We don't have performance reviews we have quarterly conversations. We don't have management we have inspiring leaders to coach and mentor. We don't have a casual dress code we simply don't have a dress code; wear what you like. And we have a lot of fun.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br> 
 </div>
 <div>
  Bringing dogs to work, company-wide give-days days, philanthropy and sustainability programs, in-office massages, walking meetings, and free daily exercise classes on-site and at the adjacent gym are just a few ways we make work feel less like work. And the results of our great culture speak for itself: we were certified as a Great Place to Work™ for the seventh year-running in 2023 and ranked in the top 12 on 
  <i>Fortune Magazine’s</i> Best Workplaces in our category for the past four years.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> So, what's it like to work here? If you're local, you'll walk into our Emeryville office each Monday morning and find 100 of your colleagues sitting on sofas, beanbag chairs, or the floor excitedly talking through the week ahead and watching one of their colleagues tell their personal life and career journey. Picture a casual and collaborative environment of a start-up, the innovative mindset of a tech company, and the stability of a company with revenue last year of over $1.3 billion, and you'll find us in the sweet spot where world-class culture meets robust business results.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br> 
 </div>
 <div>
  PNC seeks individuals who will thrive in this work environment and will help us build our culture and this high-growth company for the next phase in our amazing journey. Does this sound like you? Then read on.

Google Wallet functionality continues to expand beyond payments-related use cases to include Event Tickets and Boarding Passes.</p>
  <p> Google Wallet is becoming important to the mobile ecosystem as an increasing number of use cases become digitized, transforming the wallet from something that was once used only for mobile payments, into a secure place for storing all forms of passes and access.</p>
  <p> As the Senior Director, Engineering for Google Wallet, you will lead the Wallet engineering team and collaborate closely with the payments and Android leads with the responsibility of driving the roadmap, strategy, and execution from end to end. The team is in the midst of high growth and innovation on a global scale where user growth and engagement continues to rise globally. </p>
  <p>Google has always been about the democratization of information. We’re extending that ethos to the world of E-Commerce, supporting an open ecosystem of buyers and sellers across online and offline businesses. With over one billion shopping sessions happening per day on Google, we’re creating new innovative shopping and selling experiences that leverage Google’s Shopping Graph: a comprehensive, AI-enhanced model that understands products, sellers, brands, and reviews and how those attributes relate to one another and the product information and inventory data we receive from brands and retailers directly.</p>

  <b>Our Mission</b>
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> As humans, there are few things more exciting than meeting someone new. At Tinder, we’re inspired by the challenge of keeping the magic of human connection alive. With tens of millions of users, hundreds of millions of downloads, 2+ billion swipes per day, 20+ million matches per day, and a presence in 190+ countries, our reach is expansive—and rapidly growing.
 </div>
 <div> 
 </div>
 <div>
   We work together to solve complex problems. Behind the simplicity of every match, we think deeply about human relationships, behavioral science, network economics, AI and ML, online and real-world safety, cultural nuances, loneliness, love, sex, and more.

  <p><b>About Stellar Health:</b></p> 
  <p> Historically, US Healthcare has relied on a fee-for-service reimbursement system where providers are paid based on the quantity of patient visits and procedures, rather than the quality of health outcomes.</p> 
  <p> At Stellar Health, we help primary care providers put patient health first. Our platform - a mix of technology, people, and analytics - supports providers at the point of care, delivering real-time patient information, activating practice staff, and empowering providers and care teams with incentives that reward the work they are already doing to keep patients healthy. Using the Stellar App, our web-based, point-of-care tool; practices receive a simple checklist of recommended actions that support the best quality care. Providers and care teams are then paid monthly for each action they complete, and Payors save money in reduced healthcare costs along the way.</p> 
  <p> Stellar is a US-based Health-tech backed by Top VCs (<i>General Atlantic, Point72, &amp; Primary Venture Partners)</i> with an established product &amp; proven operating model. We've shown that we make a real difference for physician practices and their patients.</p>
