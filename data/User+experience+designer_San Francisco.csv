We have over 250 employees globally in our San Francisco, Seattle, and Delhi offices. Please reach out if you are interested in joining the future of AI!</p>
<p><b>UI / UX Designer Role</b></p>
<p>You’ll be expected to own your space: work with all disciplines on your team to build, launch and iterate. You will work closely with the product team to conceptualize and execute on designs to solve problems for our products. This is a very rare opportunity that will put you in the position of total ownership of whole product from design perspective without the risk of starting your own company. Every designer at Hive has responsibility of a whole product, although we encourage the team to provide feedback to each other.</p>
<p>You are a talented designer who consistently delivers visuals and interactions of highest quality on timelines that would be unrealistic for many others. You take pride in your creative vision, execution and communication skills. You are a strong individual contributor, but also a team player. You enjoy taking ownership of full products, and are stifled by large design organizations.</p>
<p>You get a rush from seeing your designs live in the real world.</p>
<p><b>Responsibilities</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>Lead design projects across the entire product lifecycle and multiple product launches</li>
 <li>Work with small multi-disciplinary teams. You’ll partner closely with engineering, product, and business folks to find elegant but practical solutions to design challenges</li>
 <li>Be autonomous. You’ll take full ownership of your work, and you take responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way</li>
 <li>Rapidly produce multiple concepts and prototypes; knowing when to apply pixel-perfect attention to detail, and when to make low-fi sketches and prototypes</li>
 <li>Utilize OWASP top 10 techniques to secure code from vulnerabilities</li>
 <li>Maintain awareness of industry best practices for data maintenance handling as it relates to your role</li>
 <li>Adhere to policies, guidelines and procedures pertaining to the protection of information assets</li>
 <li>Report actual or suspected security and/or policy violations/breaches to an appropriate authority</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Requirements</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>1+ year of experience designing consumer and mobile products</li>
 <li>Had ownership of many consumer products over the years, and understand what it takes to create awesome, consumer-oriented experiences</li>
 <li>Highly skilled in using design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, Sketch and/or Invision</li>
 <li>Biased toward action and execution. You get nervous if you’re not sketching concepts, tweaking flows or polishing the designs that represent the big-thinking work</li>
 <li>Great communication skills that help you work with product and engineering to make product visions come to life</li>
 <li>Constantly looking to hone your design instinct through user feedback. Whether through hands-on user research, or by designing options for an A / B test</li>
 <li>You have an online portfolio or PDF that you can share with us</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Nice to Have</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>Work experience at a leading consumer technology company like Uber, Airbnb, Houzz, Square etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>We are a group of ambitious individuals who are passionate about creating a revolutionary AI company. At Hive, you will have a steep learning curve and an opportunity to contribute to one of the fastest growing AI start-ups in San Francisco. The work you do here will have a noticeable and direct impact on the development of the company. Thank you for your interest in Hive and we hope to meet you soon!</p>

  <li> Proactively identifying and unblock knowledge sharing and communication challenges to help scale the design organization.</li>
  <li> Writing user stories and acceptance criteria for the engineering backlog.</li>
  <li> Contributing to the brand visual language and to make changes to our website hosted on Webflow.</li>

One without the other is not enough, and while we're not perfect, we strive to excel in both and are committed to going the extra mile.</p>
