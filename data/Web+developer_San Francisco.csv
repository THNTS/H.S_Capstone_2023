    At Verkada, we want to attract and retain the best employees, and compensate them in a way that appropriately and fairly values their individual contribution to the company. With that in mind, we carefully consider a number of factors to determine the appropriate starting pay for an employee, including their primary work location and an assessment of a candidate’s skills and experience, as well as market demands and internal parity. For this role, Verkada estimates a starting annual base salary will fall in the range of approximately $120,000 - $285,000. This estimate can vary based on the factors described above, so the actual starting annual base salary may be above or below this range. Annual base salary is also just one component of Verkada’s total rewards package. A Verkada employee may be eligible for additional forms of compensation, depending on their role, including sales incentives, discretionary bonuses, and/or equity in the company in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).

  <div>
   Verkada is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to be a welcoming place for everyone, and we do our best to make sure all people feel supported and connected at work. A big part of that effort is support for members and allies of our internal communities like Women at Verkada, Pride at Verkada, Multicultural at Verkada, and Parents at Verkada.

 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>About </b><b>Us:</b></h3> 
 <p> We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.</p> 
 <p> We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast—with more than 20 million users worldwide—and are excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.</p> 
 <p> Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).</p> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> About The Role:</b></h3> 
 <p> It's critical that Notion's website tells a clear story about the product and the value and transformation it makes possible for teams and companies. Given Notion's broad flexibility, it's also important that we tell a compelling story to specific audiences based on user persona, industry, geographic location, and more. Our website is the most important and versatile tool we have to personalize this experience for the millions of visitors it attracts every month, and route them to the right products and plans for them.</p> 
 <p> Success in this role looks like helping us build a dynamic, reliable, and instrumented website that captures people's attention, helps them truly understand the product's benefits, and increases conversion to paid plans. The role is on the marketing team and will partner closely with designers and developers who also sit on the team.</p> 
 <p> We're at an exciting stage as a team where we've built out the foundational pieces of our marketing website. Our next focus is on refinement and taking the user experience to the next level. We're looking for someone who cares deeply about quality and craft and wants to push the boundaries of what a modern marketing experience looks and feels like.</p> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> What You'll Achieve:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>Partner with design and product marketing to build out the website in a way that tells a strong story to more of our audiences - i.e. Notion for Engineers, Notion for Marketers.</li> 
  <li>Drive the full stack development of our site: front-end, website infrastructure, data engineering, API integrations, logging, and more.</li> 
  <li>Ensure the full site is accessible, reliable, performant, instrumented, and optimized to increase conversions across multiple geographies.</li> 
  <li>Partner closely with growth to improve the performance of every page.</li> 
  <li>Build product experiences on the website so that people can visualize and get a deep understanding how it operates and the benefits it provides.</li> 
  <li>Pioneer external satellite sites, special projects, and experiments.</li> 
  <li>Help evolve our modern, component-based marketing architecture. Our site is statically generated using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and an intuitive headless CMS.</li> 
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Skills You'll Need to Bring:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>8+ years of experience building scalable platforms.</li> 
  <li>Proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (we use TypeScript) and engineering fundamentals like Git.</li> 
  <li>Experience working with a front-end framework such as React or Vue (we use React + Next.js).</li> 
  <li>Familiarity with structured data and headless CMS platforms like Contentful.</li> 
  <li>Motivation to maximize business impact, and the ability to role up one's sleeves and get scrappy to make it happen.</li> 
  <li>Rigorous attention to detail across the full stack – someone who wants to make sure our website is a perfect ambassador for our brand on the front-end and technically sound on the server-side.</li> 
  <li>A good understanding of accessibility and a willingness to advocate for it.</li> 
  <li>Passionate about getting creative, reasoning from first principles, and not just building things because other companies like us have in past. You love to reach for the fresh and bold.</li> 
  <li>A brand mindset that gets excitement and joy out of telling stories in new ways and trying new things that haven't been seen before on a SaaS website ✨</li> 
  <li>Energy around collaborating with artists, writers, other designers, as well as engineers.</li> 
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Nice to Haves:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>An appreciation of design and understanding of what goes into crafting a great user experience.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.</p> 
 <p> Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

  <p>Assembled is building software to transform and elevate customer support teams, which often represent 20-50% of the people at a company. Our workforce management platform helps some of the fastest-growing, most innovative companies in the world—including Stripe, Zoom, and Robinhood—to schedule, forecast, and organize their support teams. We've raised $70m in funding from the likes of NEA, Emergence Capital, and Stripe itself.

You'll design and create the fundamental building blocks of our product to accelerate development and elevate the quality and consistency of our work. You'll also find yourself talking to users, brainstorming product ideas, and reaching outside your role as much as you see fit. Our front-end stack consists of React and TypeScript, and we use Figma for design. While experience with React in particular is an asset, we don't require it — we believe in quickly learning what's needed.</p>

  <li><b>Web accessibility expertise:</b> You are familiar with and driven to create products that meet or exceed accessibility standards. You are aware of automated and manual accessibility testing techniques and know how to resolve common accessibility issues.</li> 
  <li><b>Attention to UX and UI details:</b> You have keen skills in interaction design. You care about grid layout, button and form states and styles, typography, navigation, and way-finding. You have an eye for consistency and polish. Bonus: You have opinions about tables and charts and how to communicate data interactively in effective and compelling ways.</li> 
  <li><b>Platform-oriented:</b> You have some experience with ""platform"" thinking, creating foundational systems and tools for other developers. You can take ideas from many different types of users and distill them down. You should be able to make reasonable trade-offs between simplicity and flexibility.</li> 
  <li><b>Excited to educate colleagues: </b>You are a good communicator who is excited to educate and mentor others on best practices. You have experience writing clear and concise documentation, and are able to provide critical feedback on code and technical decisions.</li>

  <li>Refactor or improve existing code. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code. </li>
  <li>Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together. </li>
  <li>Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality. </li>
  <li>Review code written by other team members or other teams. </li>
  <li>Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership. </li>
  <li>Work with complex and varied data structures (APIs can be a little, uh, eccentric). </li>
  <li>Help out with our Node-based developer platform. </li>
  <li>Share what you know and learn either one-on-one or with lightning talks to the group. </li>
  <li>Give back to the community via open source and blog posts. </li>
  <li>Experiment: this is a startup-like environment so everything can change as we experiment with doing more custom partnership work. </li>
  <li>As a part of Walmart's all-hands philosophy, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible. </li>You'll also have the opportunity to specialize in a variety of areas of the codebase, including core product or platform development. Focusing on a specialization will not limit your area for growth at Walmart, as each engineer brings a unique perspective and can contribute differently to all areas. We encourage participation and will frequently have engineers contribute across teams to assist in projects. 
 </ul>
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <b>What you'll bring:</b>
 <br> 
 <ul>
  <li> You love code. You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones). </li>
  <li>You love great UX. You spend most of your time coding, but you also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, you care about more than just the code. </li>
  <li>You love learning new things. You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Node.js, GraphQL, NextJS, Nx, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it. </li>
  <li>You can balance lots of concerns. Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward. </li>You love helping others. You love sharing knowledge with the rest of your team, building shared tooling for other engineers, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers. 
 </ul>
