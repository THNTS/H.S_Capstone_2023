 The Contract Specialist within Deloitte Consulting's Quality &amp; Risk Management (QRM)/Specialized Risk group will serve as a trusted advisor to Deloitte Consulting leadership on contractual matters related to account-level agreements (which are negotiated by the Office of General Counsel (OGC)) and subordinate, engagement-specific documents for complex, information technology (IT) services (e.g., Technology Preferred Provider (TPP) relationships). The Contract Specialist will be the primary point of contact for all post-award contractual issues related to these complex, IT services relationships. Post-award support will follow a thoughtful transition from the Risk Manager who supported the negotiation of the master terms. The Contract Specialist will provide guidance and support to the business team ranging from compliance/administrative matters to the construction of highly-customized contract documents related to subordinate services.

 <br> The Contract Specialist will facilitate and lead the contractual analysis necessary to address business issues that intersect one or more contracts, provide guidance as to contractual positions, develop options using contractual strategy, protect and help grow revenue streams, while balancing the TPP client relationship. The Contract Specialist will establish direct communications with clients (primarily Procurement and Vendor Management), subcontractors and third-party technology providers to resolve business issues. The Contract Specialist will address contractual matters related to client-facing contracts, non-standard subcontracting, global contracting (internally and with the client), and technology licenses essential to hybrid engagements (including providing Risk input for flow-through provisions for subcontractors and third-party technologies agreements).
