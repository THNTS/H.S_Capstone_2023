    At Verkada, we want to attract and retain the best employees, and compensate them in a way that appropriately and fairly values their individual contribution to the company. With that in mind, we carefully consider a number of factors to determine the appropriate starting pay for an employee, including their primary work location and an assessment of a candidate’s skills and experience, as well as market demands and internal parity. For this role, Verkada estimates a starting annual base salary will fall in the range of approximately $120,000 - $285,000. This estimate can vary based on the factors described above, so the actual starting annual base salary may be above or below this range. Annual base salary is also just one component of Verkada’s total rewards package. A Verkada employee may be eligible for additional forms of compensation, depending on their role, including sales incentives, discretionary bonuses, and/or equity in the company in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).

  <div>
   Verkada is an equal opportunity employer. We strive to be a welcoming place for everyone, and we do our best to make sure all people feel supported and connected at work. A big part of that effort is support for members and allies of our internal communities like Women at Verkada, Pride at Verkada, Multicultural at Verkada, and Parents at Verkada.

- job post",-1,"<div>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>About Us:</b></h3> 
 <p> We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.</p> 
 <p> We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.</p> 
 <p> Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).</p> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> About The Role:</b></h3> 
 <p> We're looking for an engineer passionate about modern web technologies to join our Web Infrastructure team, which sits within Notion's Core Product group. We're a small team with a large mission: Our responsibilities and ownership include Notion's desktop apps, the foundation's of Notion's web client, the core component library, our dependencies (like React, webpack, or TypeScript), and educating engineers on writing performant TypeScript.</p> 
 <p> In this role, you'll join us in building features and infrastructure for the best possible version of Notion. We work closely with large open-source projects and other product teams inside Notion — and own the entirety of Notion's desktop apps.</p> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> What You'll Achieve:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>Work with the team to prototype, build, and launch innovative desktop features.</li> 
  <li>Collaborate with the open-source community on core technologies (Electron, TypeScript, Node.js, or Chromium). If you have a product dream that cannot be realized with today's open-source technologies, we'll build it.</li> 
  <li>Improve performance and reliability by hardening Notion's frontend foundations. Maybe there's a neat hack to improve React's components to load faster — or an innovative webpack solution to splitting our bundles cleverly?</li> 
  <li>You'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. We use Node.js and web technologies across the entire company and Web Infra engineers are often uniquely well-positioned to empower engineers across the entire company.</li> 
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Skills You'll Need to Bring:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li><b>Passion for and experience with web technologies</b>: JavaScript is at the core of many our tools. We don't need you to already be an expert in all of the technologies we're using but you should be excited about diving deep into technologies like Chromium, Node.js, TypeScript, or React.</li> 
  <li><b>Thoughtful problem-solving:</b> For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.</li> 
  <li><b>Pragmatic and business-oriented:</b> You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.</li> 
  <li><b>Put users first:</b> You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.</li> 
  <li><b>Not ideological about technology:</b> To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.</li> 
  <li><b>Empathetic communication:</b> You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.</li> 
  <li><b>Team player:</b> You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.</li> 
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Nice to Haves:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>You've built or maintained web apps using React, Node.js, Electron, CEF or other desktop frameworks.</li> 
  <li>You have dipped your toe into native development (or are at least open to it) - with technologies like Swift, Objective-C, or C++.</li> 
  <li>You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.</li> 
  <li>You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.</p> 
 <p> Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation made due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.<br> <br> Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits.

 <div>
  We are looking for a software engineer to join our product team and help build interfaces and APIs to interact with large language models. You will work with a team of engineers and researchers to design and implement key components of our product and platform.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> About Anthropic</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that’s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product.
 </div> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Responsibilities:</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li> Build core components of the API to access large language models</li>
  <li> Write billing, email, and other integrations with third party providers</li>
  <li> Develop conversational interfaces that leverage the language models</li>
  <li> Optimize the API and interfaces for performance, robustness, and ease of use</li>
  <li> Implement tools and processes to monitor model behavior and performance</li>
  <li> Work with researchers to improve interfaces based on interactions with real users</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> You might be a good fit if you:</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li> Have 2+ years of experience as a software engineer, preferably building APIs and/or interfaces</li>
  <li> Have strong coding skills in Python and TypeScript and experience with service-oriented architectures</li>
  <li> Take a product-focused approach and care about building solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use</li>
  <li> Enjoy working with a fast-paced team tackling cutting-edge problems in AI safety and conversational AI</li>

  <li> Have experience with REST APIs</li>
  <li> Have experience with react and frontend frameworks</li>
  <li> Have experience with containerization and DevOps</li>
  <li> Have experience with QA and testing automation</li>
  <li> Have experience with privacy and security best practices</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> Annual salary</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li> The expected salary range for this position is $300k - $520k USD.</li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Hybrid policy &amp; US visa sponsorship: </b>Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</b> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Compensation and Benefits</b>*
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Equity</b> - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Benefits</b> - Benefits we offer include:
 </div>
 <ul>
  <li>Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.</li>
  <li>401(k) plan with 4% matching.</li>
  <li>21 weeks of paid parental leave.</li>
  <li>Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!</li>
  <li>Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.</li>
  <li>Fertility benefits via Carrot.</li>
  <li>Daily lunches and snacks in our office.</li>
  <li>Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.</li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <ul>
  <li><br> <i>This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.</i></li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> How we're different</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Come work with us!</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <div>
   <br> We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (39 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
  </div>
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <div>
   <br> But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
  </div>
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <div>
   <br> Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

  When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.

 <div>
  U.S. employees have 
  <b>access</b> to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.
 </div> 
 <div>
  Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target.

- job post",-1,"<div>
 <div>
  Software is eating the world, but AI is eating software. We live in unprecedented times – AI has the potential to exponentially augment human intelligence. Every person will have a personal tutor, coach, assistant, personal shopper, travel guide, and therapist throughout life. As the world adjusts to this new reality, leading platform companies are scrambling to build LLMs at billion scale, while large enterprises figure out how to add it to their products. To make them safe, aligned and actually useful, these models need human eval and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) during pre-training, fine-tuning, and production evaluations. This is the main innovation that’s enabled ChatGPT to get such a large headstart among competition.
 </div> 
 <div>
   At Scale, our Generative AI Data Engine powers the most advanced LLMs and generative models in the world through world-class RLHF, human data generation, model evaluation, safety, and alignment. The data we are producing is some of the most important work for how humanity will interact with AI.
 </div>

   We’re looking for entrepreneurial Software Engineers to join our team. In this role, you'll be given the opportunity to build any of these products to meaningfully drive millions of dollars in revenue. You’ll also get widespread exposure to the forefront of the AI race as Scale sees it in enterprises, startups, governments, and large tech companies.
 </div> 
 <div>
   The ideal person is a natural entrepreneurial engineer who can take an ambiguous scope and lead the execution of outcomes, doing what it takes to hit them incl coding, talking to customers, defining requirements, etc. We strongly believe the best engineers own outcomes and deeply understand customer problems. This tweet by Greg Brockman summarizes it well:
 </div>

 </div> 
 <div>
   You’re excited about solving customer problems, and you pick the technologies and tactics that balance speed, function, and long-term robustness. 
 </div>
 <div>

 </div> 
 <ul>
  <li>Own large new areas within our product</li> 
  <li>Work across backend, frontend, and interacting with LLMs and/or other ML models</li> 
  <li>Deliver experiments at a high velocity and level of quality to engage our customers</li> 
  <li>Work across the entire product lifecycle from conceptualization through production</li> 
  <li>Be able, and willing, to multi-task and learn new technologies quickly</li> 
  <li>Collaborating with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new product features and experiences.<br> </li> 
 </ul>
 <div>

  <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>What we’re looking for?</b></h3>
  <ul>
   <li> We’re looking for engineers who can hit the ground running, with at least a year’s experience building production servers using Node.js. Experience with the frontend is positive but not required.</li>
   <li> As an all-remote team, we require great communication skills, particularly in writing. You must be a self-motivated manager of one with the ability to work independently, take ownership and proactively seek help when required. Prior experience working remotely will be positive but is not required.</li>
   <li> As a startup, we prefer generalists over specialists and product-focused engineers who can empathize with users. Experience working at a fast-growing startup would be positive but is not required.</li>
   <li> Experience in sales tech will be a strong positive but is not a must.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b><br> How do we work?</b></h3>
  <p> We’re an all-remote engineering team from the beginning (yes, since before the pandemic!), and we’ve built a fantastic remote-friendly culture. We support every team member to set up a great personal workspace that fits them — whether that’s a home office, a co-working space or just hanging out at a coffee shop. We are location agnostic and you can literally choose a location that works for you . Our distributed team currently sits in Singapore, India, Vietnam, Australia and Indonesia.</p>
