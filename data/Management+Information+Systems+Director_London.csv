  <p> The Ohio Expo Center is one of the most dynamic and unique event venues in the Midwest. It occupies 360 acres in the heart of Columbus – just north of downtown, minutes from Port Columbus International Airport, shopping and hotels – and at the crossroads of two major north-south and east-west interstates, it is located within a half-day drive for half the nation’s population. </p>
  <p>With more than one million square feet of event space under roof, on-site parking for 14,000 vehicles, seating for 20,000 people and ties for 2,000 cattle, the Ohio Expo Center is one of the most flexible and accommodating sites available.</p>
  <br> 
  <p> </p>
  <p><b>OUR CULTURE:</b></p> 
  <p> The Ohio Expositions Commission provides a unique career opportunity that blends public service, a family atmosphere, a focus on maintaining a year-round event facility, and producing a world-class State Fair each year. We strive to maintain an inclusive workplace and begin by being an equal opportunity employer. Our success is measured by the success of our events, which means that our partnerships with event holders and vendors, as well as our focus on the visitor experience, are at the heart of everything we do.</p>
  <br> 
  <p></p> 
  <p><b> OUR VISION:</b></p> 
  <p> To establish the Ohio Expo Center as a year-round destination event facility, and the Ohio State Fair as the premier event of its kind in the nation.</p>
  <br> 
  <p></p> 
  <p><b> OUR MISSION:</b></p> 
  <p> To work every day to ensure that the Ohio Expo Center provides a first-class, customer-focused experience for event holders, visitors, and vendors. To program a State Fair that features the best of Ohio and attracts the broadest range of Ohioans while centering our core focus around Ohio's traditions of agriculture and natural resources.</p>
  <br> 
  <p> </p>
  <p><b>OUR CORE VALUES:</b></p> 
  <p> Innovative leadership, Customer focus, Promoting the best of Ohio, Partnering for success.</p>
  <br> 
  <p></p> 
  <p><b> POSITION DESCRIPTION:</b></p> 
  <p> The Ohio Expositions Commission is seeking a visionary leader to shape the future look of the Ohio Expositions Center and Ohio State Fair, and to implement the vision of the Expo 2050 initiative. The Ohio State Fair is one of the largest state fairs in the country, and the Ohio Expo Center is one of the most dynamic and unique year-round event venues in the Midwest. The General Manager of the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair will drive the effort to give all visitors the best experience for themselves and their families.</p> 
  <p> The Ohio Expositions Commission has embarked on a long-term capital and strategic programming initiative to uphold Governor DeWine's vision of the Fair as the premier event of its kind in the nation. The strategic vision includes a new overall organization of the Ohio Expo Center property; including the renovation, modernization, or demolition of several buildings, and the addition of new exhibition facilities. The recommendations also include the development of a new town square. The improvements will benefit the State Fair as well as many events held at the site throughout the year, and the master plan framework will be used by the Expositions Commission as a guide for future development over the long-term. The General Manager will lead the continued development and implementation of this long-term strategy for the State Fair and Ohio Expo Center.</p> 
  <p> This initiative requires a visionary leader who knows how to form partnerships and promote Ohio as a destination for first-class attractions and events. Events are held year-round and range from the All-American Quarter Horse Congress to the Goodguys Rod &amp; Custom Car Show and the Ohio Beef Expo. In fact, the Ohio Expo Center is home to five of the top ten events in Columbus each year, in addition to the State Fair.</p> 
  <p> The General Manager receives direction from the Governor and the Expositions Commission, and is responsible for the management and strategic direction of the State Fair and the Expo Center. This includes supervision of the senior management team, development and operation of the agency’s operating and capital budgets, and successful implementation of fairs, exhibits and promotional events conducted on the Expo Center grounds related to agricultural, industrial, educational, sports, and recreational purposes.</p> 
  <p> The General Manager, with the Commission, provides executive leadership and community outreach to local, county, and state governments, and other community partners. The General Manager is expected to establish and maintain strong rapport with local and State officials, as well as stakeholders – including those in the agricultural, livestock, equine, and vendor communities – to ensure a collaborative approach to maximizing the use and impact of the Expo Center facilities. The General Manager will also be expected to bring a robust approach to utilizing data analytics to measure success and develop short, medium, and long-term strategies.</p>
  <br> 
  <p></p> 
  <p><b> ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS:</b></p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> Manages preparation and provides direct oversight of major events, including the annual Ohio State Fair; </li>
