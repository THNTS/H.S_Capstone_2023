 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Hybrid policy &amp; US visa sponsorship: </b>Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</b> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Compensation and Benefits</b>*
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Equity</b> - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Benefits</b> - Benefits we offer include:
 </div>
 <ul>
  <li>Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.</li>
  <li>401(k) plan with 4% matching.</li>
  <li>21 weeks of paid parental leave.</li>
  <li>Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!</li>
  <li>Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.</li>
  <li>Fertility benefits via Carrot.</li>
  <li>Daily lunches and snacks in our office.</li>
  <li>Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.</li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <ul>
  <li><br> <i>This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.</i></li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> How we're different</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Come work with us!</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    At Verkada, we want to attract and retain the best employees, and compensate them in a way that appropriately and fairly values their individual contribution to the company. With that in mind, we carefully consider a number of factors to determine the appropriate starting pay for an employee, including their primary work location and an assessment of a candidate’s skills and experience, as well as market demands and internal parity. For this role, Verkada estimates a starting annual base salary will fall in the range of approximately $120,000 - $285,000. This estimate can vary based on the factors described above, so the actual starting annual base salary may be above or below this range. Annual base salary is also just one component of Verkada’s total rewards package. A Verkada employee may be eligible for additional forms of compensation, depending on their role, including sales incentives, discretionary bonuses, and/or equity in the company in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).

 <br> Additional Information
 <p><b><br> Supplemental Questionnaire:</b><br> Applicants are required to complete a Supplemental Questionnaire as part of the online application process. The purpose of the Supplemental Questionnaire is to allow candidates to self-certify their qualifications for the position. Applicants must also complete the official application.</p>
 <p><b> Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam (Weight: 100%):</b><br> Candidates self-certifying meeting the Minimum Qualifications will be invited to participate in the online Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam. Candidates will be sent a web link via email that will allow them to take the online Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam that is designed to measure basic analytical and technical abilities associated with the target job, which may include but not be limited to:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Ability to develop web apps using programming tools (e.g., Drupal)</li>
  <li>Ability to troubleshoot problems</li>
  <li>Analytical thinking</li>
  <li>Knowledge of the functions of the hardware &amp; software components that comprise application systems</li>
  <li>Knowledge of analysis and evaluation techniques to design, implement &amp; troubleshoot systems</li>
  <li>Knowledge of standard database platforms (e.g., SQL)</li>
  <li>Ability to identify complex problems and implement solutions with minimal disruption</li>
 </ul>
 <p> This computer-administered test can be taken at home or at a time and location of one’s convenience, but only within a two-week period specified on the test notification. Candidates must have access to a computer and reliable internet connection to participate in this exam. The test consists of 25 questions and it must be completed within 60 minutes. Questions are presented one at a time on the computer screen. There is no penalty for guessing. Candidates may not return to questions presented earlier in the exam; they can only move forward. A passing score must be attained on this test in order to continue further in the selection process. Test questions and answers are not available for public inspection or review.</p>
 <p><b> Note:</b> A passing score must be achieved on all examination components in order to be placed on the Eligible List. The hiring department may administer additional position-specific procedures to make final hiring decisions. Achieving a passing score in one class does not guarantee placement on eligible lists for the other classes. You must apply to each class for which you would like to be considered. There are different exams for each of the SF Civic Tech specialty areas (Applications, Networks, Security and Systems), and each class (1041, 1042, 1043 and 1044) has a different passing score for each exam.</p>
 <p> Candidates’ scores on the Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam may also be applied to other announcements involving other job titles, when directed by the Human Resources Director.</p>
 <p><b> Score Banking: </b>Scores attained on the Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam will be 'banked' for three years, starting from the date of the examination. This means that, during this three-year time period, candidates need not take this test again. Rather, if another announcement you applied to and are deemed qualified for requires the Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam and is held within one year of your Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam date your score will be automatically applied to that announcement. However, after one year, a candidate has the option to either (a) apply their test score to the other announcement or (b) re-take the test. Re-testing is permitted no sooner than one year from the date of the test and only in association with a candidate’s eligibility for another announcement to which the candidate has applied and is deemed qualified. If a candidate opts to re-test, the re-test score becomes the candidate’s official score since it is the most recent.</p>
 <p> If a significant modification is made to this exam in the future, the application of “banked” scores may no longer be appropriate. In such a rare circumstance, candidates with “banked” scores would be required to re-take the exam sooner than the three-year period specified above should they apply to another job opportunity where the modified exam is used.</p>
 <p><b> Eligible List/Score Report:</b> A confidential eligible list of applicant names that have passed the civil service examination process will be created, and used for certification purposes only. An examination score report will be established, so applicants can view the ranks, final scores and number of eligible candidates. Applicant information, including names of applicants on the eligible list, shall not be made public unless required by law. However, an eligible list shall be made available for public inspection, upon request, once the eligible list is exhausted or expired and referrals resolved. The eligible list/score report resulting from this civil service examination process is subject to change after adoption (e.g., as a result of appeals), as directed by the Human Resources Director or the Civil Service Commission.</p>
 <p> Upon passing the exam, candidates will be placed on the eligible list for a period of 12 months.</p>

 <br> Additional Information
 <p><b><br> Supplemental Questionnaire:</b><br> Applicants are required to complete a Supplemental Questionnaire as part of the online application process. The purpose of the Supplemental Questionnaire is to allow candidates to self-certify their qualifications for the position. Applicants must also complete the official application.</p>
 <p><b> Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam (Weight: 100%):</b><br> Candidates self-certifying meeting the Minimum Qualifications will be invited to participate in the online Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam. Candidates will be sent a web link via email that will allow them to take the online Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam that is designed to measure basic analytical and technical abilities associated with the target job, which may include but not be limited to:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Ability to develop web apps using programming tools (e.g., Drupal)</li>
  <li>Ability to troubleshoot problems</li>
  <li>Analytical thinking</li>
  <li>Knowledge of the functions of the hardware &amp; software components that comprise application systems</li>
  <li>Knowledge of analysis and evaluation techniques to design, implement &amp; troubleshoot systems</li>
  <li>Knowledge of standard database platforms (e.g., SQL)</li>
  <li>Ability to identify complex problems and implement solutions with minimal disruption</li>
 </ul>
 <p> This computer-administered test can be taken at home or at a time and location of one’s convenience, but only within a two week period specified on the test notification. Candidates must have access to a computer and reliable internet connection to participate in this exam. The test consists of 25 questions and it must be completed within 60 minutes. Questions are presented one at a time on the computer screen. There is no penalty for guessing. Candidates may not return to questions presented earlier in the exam; they can only move forward. A passing score must be attained on this test in order to continue further in the selection process. Test questions and answers are not available for public inspection or review.</p>
 <p><b> Note</b>: A passing score must be achieved on all examination components in order to be placed on the Eligible List. The hiring department may administer additional position-specific procedures to make final hiring decisions. Achieving a passing score in one class does not guarantee placement on eligible lists for the other classes. You must apply to each class you would like to be considered. There are different exams for each of the SF Civic Tech specialty areas (Applications, Networks, Security and Systems), and each class (1041, 1042, 1043 and 1044) has a different passing score for each exam.</p>
 <p> Candidates’ scores on the Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam may also be applied to other announcements involving other job titles, when directed by the Human Resources Director.</p>
 <p><b> Score Banking: </b>Scores attained on the Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam will be 'banked' for three years, starting from the date of the examination. This means that, during this three-year time period, candidates need not take this test again. Rather, if another announcement you applied to and are deemed qualified for requires the Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam and is held within one year of your Tech Engineer – Applications Core Exam date your score will be automatically applied to that announcement. However, after one year, a candidate has the option to either (a) apply his/her test score to the other announcement or (b) re-take the test. Re-testing is permitted no sooner than one year from the date of the test and only in association with a candidate’s eligibility for another announcement to which the candidate has applied and is deemed qualified. If a candidate opts to re-test, the re-test score becomes the candidate’s official score since it is the most recent.</p>
 <p> If a significant modification is made to this exam in the future, the application of “banked” scores may no longer be appropriate. In such a rare circumstance, candidates with “banked” scores would be required to re-take the exam sooner than the three-year period specified above should they apply to another job opportunity where the modified exam is used.</p>
 <p><b> Eligible List/Score Report:</b> A confidential eligible list of applicant names that have passed the civil service examination process will be created and used for certification purposes only. An examination score report will be established, so applicants can view the ranks, final scores and number of eligible candidates. Applicant information, including names of applicants on the eligible list, shall not be made public unless required by law. However, an eligible list shall be made available for public inspection, upon request, once the eligible list is exhausted or expired and referrals resolved. The eligible list/score report resulting from this civil service examination process is subject to change after adoption (e.g., as a result of appeals), as directed by the Human Resources Director or the Civil Service Commission.</p>
 <p> Upon passing the exam, candidates will be placed on the eligible list for a period of 12 months.</p>

- job post",-1,"<div>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>About Us:</b></h3> 
 <p> We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.</p> 
 <p> We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.</p> 
 <p> Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).</p> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> About The Role:</b></h3> 
 <p> We're looking for an engineer passionate about modern web technologies to join our Web Infrastructure team, which sits within Notion's Core Product group. We're a small team with a large mission: Our responsibilities and ownership include Notion's desktop apps, the foundation's of Notion's web client, the core component library, our dependencies (like React, webpack, or TypeScript), and educating engineers on writing performant TypeScript.</p> 
 <p> In this role, you'll join us in building features and infrastructure for the best possible version of Notion. We work closely with large open-source projects and other product teams inside Notion — and own the entirety of Notion's desktop apps.</p> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> What You'll Achieve:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>Work with the team to prototype, build, and launch innovative desktop features.</li> 
  <li>Collaborate with the open-source community on core technologies (Electron, TypeScript, Node.js, or Chromium). If you have a product dream that cannot be realized with today's open-source technologies, we'll build it.</li> 
  <li>Improve performance and reliability by hardening Notion's frontend foundations. Maybe there's a neat hack to improve React's components to load faster — or an innovative webpack solution to splitting our bundles cleverly?</li> 
  <li>You'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. We use Node.js and web technologies across the entire company and Web Infra engineers are often uniquely well-positioned to empower engineers across the entire company.</li> 
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Skills You'll Need to Bring:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li><b>Passion for and experience with web technologies</b>: JavaScript is at the core of many our tools. We don't need you to already be an expert in all of the technologies we're using but you should be excited about diving deep into technologies like Chromium, Node.js, TypeScript, or React.</li> 
  <li><b>Thoughtful problem-solving:</b> For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.</li> 
  <li><b>Pragmatic and business-oriented:</b> You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.</li> 
  <li><b>Put users first:</b> You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.</li> 
  <li><b>Not ideological about technology:</b> To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.</li> 
  <li><b>Empathetic communication:</b> You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.</li> 
  <li><b>Team player:</b> You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.</li> 
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Nice to Haves:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>You've built or maintained web apps using React, Node.js, Electron, CEF or other desktop frameworks.</li> 
  <li>You have dipped your toe into native development (or are at least open to it) - with technologies like Swift, Objective-C, or C++.</li> 
  <li>You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.</li> 
  <li>You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.</p> 
 <p> Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation made due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.<br> <br> Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role's scope and complexity, and the candidate's experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York, the estimated base salary range for this role is $130,000 - $250,000 per year.<br> <br> #LI-Onsite</p>

  <div>

 <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Role Description</b></h2> 
 <div>
  Our strategy starts with our mission: how do we build the right set of products that can help our customers work in a more enlightened way? If the first big problem Dropbox solved was getting your files in the cloud, the new problem we're solving is helping you organize your life.
 </div> 
 <div>
  As we're evolving the core business from syncing and sharing files, we are looking for Software Engineers to come build the next generation of new products for collaboration and distributed work. Product Engineers thrive working across technologies and codebases, but are also involved in various product development cycle stages. Along the way they help representing users needs through close partnership with product, design, and user research.
 </div> 
 <div>
  In this role you will deliver best-in-breed software by building robust systems that power optimized user experiences on marquee projects like Dropbox Paper, Transfer, or Family. As a Product Engineer, you will use data-driven approaches to conduct experiments or iterate features, while ensuring that the software we write will last and scale.
 </div> 
 <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Responsibilities</b></h2> 
 <ul>

  <li>You will partner with product managers, designers and analysts to deeply understand the needs of our users and build a product that serves those needs</li> 
  <li>You will develop and execute against both short and long-term roadmaps, making effective tradeoffs between business impact, user experience, and a high-quality technical foundation</li> 
  <li>You will improve the team and company – you will be an active participant in our culture (mentorship, interviewing, and new initiatives)</li> 
  <li>You will support your fellow engineers through feedback, code reviews, and advancement of internal tools and processes</li> 
 </ul>
 <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Requirements</b></h2> 
 <ul>
  <li>BS degree in Computer Science or related technical field involving coding (e.g., physics or mathematics), or equivalent technical experience</li>

  <li>Previous success developing and shipping a large-scale web application with a user-empathetic mindset</li> 
  <li>Skilled at building user-facing software and supporting systems and libraries for the web and/or desktop</li> 
  <li>You can handle full-stack projects and are able to build a minimum working product quickly</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Many teams at Dropbox run Services with on-call rotations, which entails being available for calls during both core and non-core business hours. If a team has an on-call rotation, all engineers on the team are expected to participate in the rotation as part of their employment. Applicants are encouraged to ask for more details of the rotations to which the applicant is applying.</p>

  <p>At Dropbox, we strive to be a great place for all Dropboxers to grow and be recognized for that growth. This job posting reflects broad requirements, and represents two potential levels of role. Through our assessment process, we will identify your level that ties to compensation based on your experience and technical expertise along with the scope of the role.</p> 
  <p> For candidates hired in San Francisco metro, New York City metro, or Seattle metro, the expected salary/On-Target Earnings (OTE) range for the role is currently $154,700 - $182,000 - $209,300 if you are assessed at the IC2 level. If you are instead assessed at the IC3 level, the expected salary/On-Target Earnings (OTE) range for the role is currently $187,000 - $220,000 - $253,000.</p> 
  <p> For candidates hired in the following locations: Austin (TX) metro, Chicago metro, California (outside SF metro), Colorado, Connecticut (outside NYC metro), Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York (outside NYC metro), Oregon, Pennsylvania (outside NYC or DC metro), Washington (outside Seattle metro) and Washington DC metro, the expected salary/On-Target Earnings (OTE) range for the role is currently $139,200 - $163,800 - $188,400 if you are assessed at the IC2 level. If you are instead assessed at the IC3 level, the expected salary/On-Target Earnings (OTE) range for the role is currently $168,300 - $198,000 - $227,700.</p>

  <p> Range(s) is subject to change. Dropbox takes a number of factors into account when determining individual starting pay, including job and level they are hired into, location/metropolitan area, skillset, and peer compensation. Dropbox uses the zip code of an employee's remote work location to determine which metropolitan pay range we use.</p>

 <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>More about Recidiviz</b></h2> 
 <p> Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Schmidt Futures, Ford Foundation, and the Mozilla Foundation.</p> 
 <p> Now, four years in, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) 11 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers 25% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.</p> 
 <p> To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2022 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our recent TED Talk. And if you're really keen to see our work, you can dive into our Github :).</p> 
 <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> An important note</b></h2> 
 <p> Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application. Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look – you might be great for another role and/or another time!</p>
