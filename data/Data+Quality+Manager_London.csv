  <br> 
  <p></p> 
  <p><b> About Us</b></p> 
  <p> The Ohio Department of Aging (ODA) is a cabinet-level agency within the executive branch of the Ohio state government. The director of ODA is a member of the Governor's cabinet, serving as principal advisor and advocate for 2.8 million older adults and their families. Through services, supports, and activities that cover a wide spectrum of issues, ODA strives to achieve its mission to foster sound public policy, research, and initiatives that benefit older Ohioans.</p> 
  <p> ODA is the federally designated agency responsible for developing and administering multi-year state plans that advocate for, and provide assistance to, older Ohioans and their families. In addition to the centralized functions, the agency designates and contracts with community providers and a network of 12 Area Agencies on Aging, who manage a wide array of federal and state-funded supportive services. These services assist older adults to live as independently as possible; promote healthy aging and active community involvement; and support family members in their vital care giving role.</p> 
  <p> To promote the agency's vision of Ohio - the best place to age in the nation, ODA actively collaborates with consumers and stakeholders from key associations, governments, and the public. The independent Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman and the Board of Executives of Long-Term Services and Supports are also located within ODA.</p> 
  <p> Our core values are:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><i>Promote Independence</i> - Provide resources that foster independence and autonomy throughout the lifespan.</li> 
   <li><i>Empower Communities</i> - Deliver sustainable, relevant solutions that empower communities to act within the best interest of their elders.</li> 
   <li><i>Challenge Ageism</i> - Promote new perspectives of aging that challenge the traditional declinist narrative.</li> 
   <li><i>Advocate for Excellence</i> - Advocate with and for Ohio’s elders to ensure their voices are heard and their needs are met.</li> 
   <li><i>Engage in Innovation</i> - Engage the aging network by staying innovative, flexible, and attentive to the evolving needs of our partners and stakeholders.</li>
  </ul>
  <br> 
  <p></p> 
  <p><b> About the Division</b></p> 
  <p> The Information Systems Division (ISD) provides for the diverse technology needs of the department and Ohio’s aging network, supporting 25,000+ system users. The core teams within the division are:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Technology Management administers Infrastructure and Operations, Data Management and Governance, Data Security and Compliance, and IT Service Management</p> </li> 
   <li><p>Application Development and Management specializes in analyzing, designing, creating and maintaining computer software applications</p> </li> 
   <li><p>IT Strategy and Delivery Management oversees the processes, tools, and communication methods to continuously capture and translate business strategies into an aligned IT portfolio ensuring sustainable, value-driven outcomes.</p> </li> 
  </ul>
  <ul>
   <li><p>Design Innovation and Architecture continuously cultivates new ideas through diverse collaborations to innovate and influence new practice paradigms</p></li>
  </ul>
  <br> 
  <p> </p>
  <p>Today’s approach to healthy aging is more holistic and connected than ever before. This means that our aging services platforms need to support a greater connected ecosystem where information and interoperability are essential for long-term success, person-centered care, and quality outcomes. Comprehensive platforms must connect the ecosystem to ensure that every part of the solution works together to create a positive, seamless experience, reducing manual work and advancing data analytics.</p>
