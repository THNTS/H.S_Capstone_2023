- job post",-1,"<div>
 <div>
  Anthropic’s AI technology is amongst the most capable and safe in the world. However, large language models are a new type of intelligence, and the art of instructing them in a way that delivers the best results is still in its infancy — it’s a hybrid between programming, instructing, and teaching. You will figure out the best methods of prompting our AI to accomplish a wide range of tasks, then document these methods to build up a library of tools and a set of tutorials that allows others to learn prompt engineering, as well as work with high value partners to directly solve their challenges.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> Given that the field of prompt-engineering is arguably less than 2 years old, this position is a bit hard to hire for! As a result, we ask that you share with us a specific prompt engineering project on LLMs that you’re proud of in your application! Ideally this project should show off a complex and clever prompting architecture or a systematic evaluation of an LLM’s behavior.

  <b><br> We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</b> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

 <div>
  <b><br> Compensation and Benefits</b>*
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Equity</b> - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Benefits</b> - Benefits we offer include:
 </div>
 <ul>
  <li>Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.</li>
  <li>401(k) plan with 4% matching.</li>
  <li>21 weeks of paid parental leave.</li>
  <li>Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!</li>
  <li>Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.</li>
  <li>Fertility benefits via Carrot.</li>
  <li>Daily lunches and snacks in our office.</li>
  <li>Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.</li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <ul>
  <li><br> <i>This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.</i></li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> How we're different</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Come work with us!</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

- job post",-1,"<div>
 <div>
  You’ll lead the “tokens” team, which manages infrastructure related to data and prepares data for our training runs. We believe that there are three key ingredients to making progress in AI: compute, data, and algorithms. Data is often paid the least attention to externally, but we think it can make as much of a difference to the quality of the model as each of the other two. This team has three critical responsibilities that all must be executed well in order for Anthropic to succeed:
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> 1. Science of Data:</b> Once we’ve acquired data, we need to figure out the best ways to use it and make sure we’re in shape for training runs. This work primarily consists of coming up with ideas, doing ML experiments, and following up with careful analysis of the results.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> 2. Data Availability:</b> Large language models need significant amounts of data to be able to train, and having the necessary number of tokens is essential for improving our language models. The data needs to be high quality and diverse for the performance of the model and also to supply research datasets.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> 3. Infrastructure:</b> The team maintains data pipeline infrastructure as well as the tokenizer required to rapidly process data on the order of terabytes. This infrastructure is relied upon by other research teams to easily manipulate their data as well as the tokens team to quickly turn around training datasets and do research.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> About Anthropic </b>
 </div>
 <div>
  Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that’s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product.
 </div> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Responsibilities:</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li> Be responsible for delivering as large and high quality of a dataset as possible for our large training runs</li>
  <li> Prioritize the team’s work in improving our tokens and infrastructure, in collaboration with senior engineers and other stakeholders</li>
  <li> Steer cycles and processes of our research in support of the science of data work</li>
  <li> Guide the team through growth and evolving research focus in uncharted territory</li>
  <li> Coach and develop your reports to decide how they would like to advance in their careers and help them do so</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> You may be a good fit if you:</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li> Believe that advanced AI systems could have a transformative effect on the world, and want to help make sure that transformation goes well</li>
  <li> Have an interest in understanding the role of data in language models, working on large scale systems or orchestrating one-off research tasks</li>
  <li> Are an experienced manager and enjoy practicing management as a discipline</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> Requirements: </b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li>At least 1 year of prior engineering management or equivalent experience.</li>
  <li> You can come into our San Francisco office at least 25% of the time.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> Important skills:</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li><b> People management</b>: Coaching, performance evaluation, mentorship, and career development.</li>
  <li><b> Project (research) management</b>: Prioritization, communicating across team/org boundaries, and keeping research on track.</li>
  <li><b> Technical expertise</b>: Keeping a strong understanding of which datasets are valuable to the training, understanding how data works in language model training and being able to maintain good practices on the codebase and infrastructure. We expect this to be a skill that is developed on the job, and will be looking for related experiences such as having research experience, being well-read in LLMs, or having led work that involves rapid hacking and interpreting complex results. Skills in research management will be prioritized over engineering management.</li>
  <li><b> Recruiting</b>: Predicting staffing needs, designing interview loops, evaluating candidates, closing candidates.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> Annual Salary:</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li> The expected salary range for this position is $300k - $520k.</li>
 </ul>
 <div>
  <b> Logistics</b>
 </div>
 <div>
  <b> Location-based hybrid policy: </b>Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. For this role, we prefer candidates who are able to be in our office 
  <b>more than 25% of the time</b>. We have a preference for candidates who are based in the Bay Area, as most of the team is in San Francisco, though we believe that candidates with skills managing a remote team can be just as effective.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Deadline to apply</b>: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> US visa sponsorship:</b> We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</b> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Compensation and Benefits</b>*
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Equity</b> - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Benefits</b> - Benefits we offer include:
 </div>
 <ul>
  <li>Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.</li>
  <li>401(k) plan with 4% matching.</li>
  <li>21 weeks of paid parental leave.</li>
  <li>Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!</li>
  <li>Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.</li>
  <li>Fertility benefits via Carrot.</li>
  <li>Daily lunches and snacks in our office.</li>
  <li>Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.</li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <ul>
  <li><br> <i>This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.</i></li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> How we're different</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>

 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>About Us:</b></h3> 
 <p> We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.</p> 
 <p> We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.</p> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> About The Role</b></h3> 
 <p> Notion is an incredibly powerful set of building blocks that can be used to build nearly anything, from personal dashboards to all-in-one student setups to entire companies-in-a-box. Notion Templates are how users build and share these setups. Templates help both users and creators: users start on Notion with high quality setups and find new ways to use Notion, and creators make thousands of dollars and grow online brands for themselves. Some creators have found so much success building templates they quit their full-time jobs and earn their livings building and selling Notion templates.</p> 
 <p> Recently, we launched a revamped Notion Templates experience (notion.so/templates) that includes thousands of templates across hundreds of categories, featuring the work of hundreds of creators. We're looking for someone to manage this new template marketplace and the community of creators behind it. Think: managing the Apple App Store in 2008.</p> 
 <p> As a part of the broader Templates + Community Content group at Notion, you will help both Notion users and creators. On the user side, you'll grow the number of users consuming and signing up templates via content and editorial roadmaps, marketing campaigns, landing pages, and featured content. On the creator side, you'll grow submission quality and quantity via community programs, submission guidelines, creator tools, as well as international outreach campaigns. Plus, you'll also be responsible for all of Notion's first-party templates, available at notion.so/@notion. Beyond this, you'll also contribute directly to Notion's product roadmap by channeling insights from template users and creators to enhance both sides.</p> 
 <p> You'll report into Notion's Product organization, and work closely with engineering, design, marketing, and sales. It's a ""swiss army knife"" role that combines a broad combination of skills to build something awesome that is core to Notion's mission and direction.</p> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> What You'll Achieve</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>Grow the number of Notion users discovering and using templates</li> 
  <li>Grow the number of 3rd-party creators building and submitting Notion templates</li> 
  <li>Expand the use cases that Notion can successfully accommodate</li> 
  <li>Manage notion.so/templates and the thousands of pieces of content available there</li> 
  <li>Manage Notion's template creator programs, communities, and awards</li> 
  <li>Produce high-quality Notion first-party templates and content/editorial items to accompany</li> 
  <li>Improve Notion's core product via insights and improvements</li> 
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Skills You'll Need to Bring:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>0-6 years of work experience</li> 
  <li>Scrappiness: willing to work to get things done, at times skewing outside normal job descriptions</li> 
  <li>Good product/design instincts: can identify + build solutions to solve user problems</li> 
  <li>Basic data skills: proficiency with SQL, basic analysis, etc.</li> 
  <li>Strong written skills: can write clear, useful copy for template blog + landing pages</li> 
  <li>Passionate fans of Notion: use it for personal, student, and/or work life</li> 
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Nice to Haves</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>Basic software engineering background: databases + programming 101</li> 
  <li>People management: may hire and grow a team of folks to do this</li> 
  <li>Have worked in growth on fast-growing products before</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.</p> 
 <p> Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures.
