 <ul>
  <li><p> Leading the creation of personas, customer journeys, conceptual prototypes, and responsive interfaces that follow interaction design and usability best practices.</p></li>
  <li><p> Producing clean, informative, and concise presentations to clients and internal teams that communicate the rationale behind your designs</p></li>
  <li><p> Giving insightful and constructive feedback on the design of the experience, including interactions, information architecture, content, layout, and overall alignment with goals and brand.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li><p> Performing competitive assessments and providing innovative alternatives, as well as researching and understanding design and technology trends.</p></li>
  <li><p> Contributing to the evolution of CX methodologies, capabilities, approaches, and toolset. Attending and leading CX meetings and trainings. Engaging in professional development and industry involvement.</p></li>
  <li><p> Strong knowledge of user interface design best practices across various platforms, including web, OS-native, and embedded apps. Advocating the benefits of accessible experience and visual design with clients and team members.</p></li>
 </ul>
</div> 
<br> 
<div>
 Qualifications
 <ul>
  <li><p><br> 8+ years of professional experience, ideally in a design consultancy or digital agency</p></li>
  <li><p> 4-year degree in design, fine arts, or similar preferred</p></li>
  <li><p> Demonstrated ability to juggle multiple projects accounts simultaneously, while successfully delivering against scope and budget.</p></li>
  <li><p> Experience with multiple domains of human-centered design including user and market research, product and experience strategy, information architecture, experience design, content strategy, optimization, and customer insight.</p></li>
  <li><p> Proven written, verbal, conceptual, and visual communication skills</p></li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li><p> Skilled with tools such as Sketch or Figma, Adobe CS (XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign), InVision, and PowerPoint</p></li>
