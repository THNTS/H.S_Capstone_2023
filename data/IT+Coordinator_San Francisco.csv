 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>About Us:</b></h3> 
 <p> We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.</p> 
 <p> We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.</p> 
 <p> Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).</p> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> About The Role:</b></h3> 
 <p> The People Team at Notion exists to help build a generational company that enables people to do their best &amp; most meaningful work. And we believe hiring exceptional talent, at the right time, is the best path forward in order to achieve our company’s ambitious goals.

 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> What You'll Achieve:</b></h3> 
 <ul>

  <li><b>Coordination and scheduling at scale:</b> You'll coordinate and schedule a high volume of candidate interviews in an organized, timely, and consistent manner.</li>

  <li>Excellent time management, prioritization, and organizational skills— you are highly self-motivated and driven to go above and beyond what is required.</li> 
  <li>You are kind, warm, and thoughtful— as you'll represent the company to interact with thousands of candidates you touch each year. Some who can stay calm and organized in a fast-paced environment.</li> 
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Nice to Haves:</b></h3> 
 <ul>
  <li>Experience with Greenhouse, GoodTime, LinkedIn Recruiter, Gem, or Ashby.</li>

- job post",-1,"<div>
 Company Description
 <p><br> Are you passionate about promoting environmental awareness? Do you love using your skillsets to engage children and youth about environmental issues? If so, we invite you to take advantage of an opportunity to join a team in building a better future for San Francisco.</p>
 <p><b> Who We Are</b><br> The San Francisco Department of the Environment (SF Environment) advances climate protection and enhances quality of life for all San Franciscans. SF Environment is a department within the City and County of San Francisco, a local government committed to innovation, leadership and collaboration in creating environmental change. SF Environment is recognized worldwide for its environmental policies and programs, which center on achieving zero waste, reducing toxic chemical hazards, advancing environmental justice, promoting sustainable transportation modes, expanding clean energy infrastructure, greening our built environment, and protecting our urban forest. We’re a passionate, mission-driven team that values credibility, collaboration, impact, innovation and equity. SF Environment is also a great place to work, offering an attractive benefits package that includes healthcare and retirement.</p>
 <p><b> SF Environment - Statement on Racial Equity</b><br> For over 20 years, SF Environment has worked with San Francisco’s Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities to mitigate environmental burdens, increase accessibility of environmental programs and benefits, engage community members, and improve health outcomes. BIPOC communities are disproportionately exposed to environmental stressors that include air and soil pollution, illegal dumping of toxics and other materials, industrial land uses and transportation impacts. They are more likely to live in housing conditions with limited access to green space and where poor indoor air quality from pests, mold, and the use of toxic products contributes to the prevalence of asthma and other health disparities. They are more likely to be employed in areas with high levels of exposure to toxics. Now, they are the first communities feeling the impacts of climate change, with the fewest resources to respond. SF Environment has a longstanding commitment to the principles of environmental justice, whereby communities most impacted by environmental stressors and climate change are prioritized and the long-time work of community leaders is recognized and supported. We are committed to uplifting the contributions of local environmental leaders of diverse racial backgrounds and ensuring that racial equity is the cornerstone of all of our programs, policies, and services.</p>

  <b><br> About Anthropic</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.
 </div> 
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Responsibilities:</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li> Elevate our existing spaces and create a more fun and functional place to work</li>
  <li> Partner with people ops, security, and vendors to ensure that our office supports focused work and the fruitful exchange of ideas</li>
  <li> Manage the vendors who handle day-to-day operations, including food and snacks, deliveries, inventory management, cleaning, and security</li>
  <li> Develop and preserve office culture and norms, for example our COVID or guest policies</li>
  <li> ""Keep the lights on,” including event &amp; meeting support, emergency planning, managing maintenance and repair requests, and helping us stay compliant with local codes</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> You may be a good fit if you:</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li> Have prior experience in facilities coordination, ideally 2+ years</li>
  <li> Enjoy juggling multiple projects, especially in a fast-paced and dynamic startup environment</li>
  <li> Have a service and solution-based mindset/internal customer orientation, and are excited to take on essential but behind-the-scenes tasks to help our teams do impactful work</li>
  <li> Enjoy rolling up your sleeves and handling day-to-day tasks as they arise–no task is too big or too small</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b> Strong candidates may also have:</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li> Prior experience with vendor management</li>
  <li> Interest in artificial intelligence and care that it is developed safely and beneficially</li>

 <ul>
  <li> The expected salary range for this position is $115 - $160k.</li>
 </ul>

 <br> 
 <div>
  <b>Deadline to apply</b>: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> US visa sponsorship: </b>We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</b> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Compensation and Benefits</b>*
 </div>
 <div>
   Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Equity</b> - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Benefits</b> - Benefits we offer include:
 </div>
 <ul>
  <li>Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.</li>
  <li>401(k) plan with 4% matching.</li>
  <li>21 weeks of paid parental leave.</li>
  <li>Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!</li>
  <li>Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.</li>
  <li>Fertility benefits via Carrot.</li>
  <li>Daily lunches and snacks in our office.</li>
  <li>Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.</li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <ul>
  <li><br> <i>This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.</i></li>
 </ul>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> How we're different</b>
 </div>
 <div>
   We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We're trying to build a core of knowledge and intuition about the most robustly effective innovations in AI, and so thoroughly-documented null results are almost as valuable as positive discoveries. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <br> The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  <b><br> Come work with us!</b>
 </div>
 <div>
