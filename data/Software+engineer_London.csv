 </ul>
 <p> Etegent has a long history of working with co-op and intern students to help them achieve their professional goals. In fact, many of our full-time engineers began their careers with Etegent as co-ops or interns.

 <p> Etegent’s software development group supports the machine learning group in maintaining and developing several AI/ML frameworks and tools leveraged by multiple research projects. The frameworks are developed fully in Python, heavily leveraging packages such as PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, and several others. In this role, you may be asked to:</p>
 <ul>
  <li> Develop new functionality to support the needs of Etegent’s machine learning group.</li>
  <li> Design and implement effective unit tests for existing functionality using pytest.</li>

  <li> Comfortable working with Windows and Linux operating systems</li>
  <li> Be currently enrolled and pursuing a Bachelor’s degree.</li>
 </ul>
 <p><b> Preferred Qualifications:</b></p>
 <p> (Our expectations will vary based on the education level of the applicant.)</p>
 <ul>
  <li> Experience using Python.</li>
  <li> Familiarity with fundamental machine learning concepts.</li>
  <li> Experience measuring and improving software efficiency and optimizing for execution speed.</li>
  <li> Experience using Git or other version control systems in a collaborative environment.</li>
  <li> Experience with Bash or other scripting languages</li>
 </ul>
 <p> <b>Working at Etegent:</b></p>
 <p> At Etegent, you'll be a part of an organization that combines a small-company family feel with big-company resources and opportunities. Which is why in addition to your competitive salary, medical/dental/vision plan, and a generous annual company 401(k) contribution, you'll enjoy the following:</p>
 <p><b><i> Flexibility:</i></b> Not a morning person? No problem. We only ask that you begin your day by 10:00 a.m.</p>
 <p><b><i> Casual Dress:</i></b> Don't be fooled by the casual clothes and laid-back atmosphere. We're changing the world around here!</p>
 <p><b><i> Professional Development:</i></b> Continuous learning on us. Reimbursement is provided for up to 100% of qualifying education expenses.</p>
 <p><b><i> Food:</i></b> Keep your energy levels up with our well-supplied snack and beverage kitchen and enjoy a weekly lunch with your talented colleagues on Free Lunch Fridays.</p>

     <div> 
      <p>The University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI)is in search of motivated, innovative team members to further ongoing government artificial intelligence research applied to autonomy decision and execution services. The qualified candidate will join the Autonomy Systems Group on a hybrid schedule.</p> 
      <p> We blend the use of common programming languages like Java, Python, and C++ with lesser known logic programming solvers and our own complex event processing domain-specific language. We wrap it all into a DevSecOps framework that deploys through containers and scales from edge platform computing up to the cloud.</p> 
      <p> Our autonomy services support multiple echelons of dynamic mission planning and execution from the strategic level down through vehicle autonomy. Planners and operators at each level interact with the autonomy to define and refine their goals, preferences, and constraints. Using this intent together with context models and local information, the decision services reason over possibilities to determine the best course of action for the situation.</p> 
      <p> The role will focus on developing autonomous agents that choose and execute courses of action in simulated scenarios and interact with the simulated environment. The qualified candidate will join a multidisciplinary team to model situations for decision services, develop agent behaviors, create task monitors, and integrate agents with other autonomy services.</p> 
      <p> No candidate comes into our group with all of the skills that we use on a daily basis, so we invest in tutorials and mentoring. We are looking for candidates that bring pragmatic expertise in at least one aspect of what we do (e.g.: software development and integration, logic programming, game theory, optimization, ontologies, planning languages) and we will give you the opportunity to grow into the others.</p>

     <div> 
      <p>To apply please submit a cover letter addressing each minimum qualification and any applicable preferred qualifications that you meet.</p> 
      <p> A federal court on December 7, 2021, issued a ruling that suspends the COVID-19 vaccine requirement that applies to federal contractors nationwide. With this development, the University will pause any enforcement action against employees who have not complied with the requirement to be fully vaccinated by Dec. 8, 2021 or to have requested an exemption to maintain their employment status.</p> 
      <p> The University will continue to monitor the state of the pandemic on campus and in the community as well as developments in federal and state requirements, and also will continue to regularly consult with public health officials and our medical panel. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, our protocols and requirements are subject to change depending on conditions on campus or in our community, and government requirements.</p>
