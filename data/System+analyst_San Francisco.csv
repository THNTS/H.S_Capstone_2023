 <div>
  <br> 
  <p><b>THE DEPARTMENT:</b></p> 
  <p> The Alameda County Probation Department is an essential element of the County’s system of public protection and human services. The Department’s role is to reduce the impact of crime in the community by providing accurate, comprehensive and timely information and recommendations to the Courts, providing community-based sanctions and treatment for offenders, and working cooperatively with law enforcement agencies and community organizations with similar objectives. The Department provides a wide range of mandated and discretionary investigative, advisory, and supervisory services to adult and juvenile probationers pursuant to State law and the County Charter.</p> 
  <p><b> THE POSITION:</b></p> 
  <p> Under general direction, to analyze department business system needs, and produce, maintain and update software systems to meet those needs. Information Systems Analysts are responsible for gathering requirements, defining problems and recommending solutions, writing program and database design specifications, modifying existing systems and providing production support for users and their systems. Information Systems Analysts may also prepare instructional material for department staff, act as project manager on projects; and performs related duties as required.<br> <br> <br> </p>
  <p><b>DISTINGUISHING FEATURES:</b></p> 
  <p> This is the fully functioning Systems Analyst classification in the Information Systems class series. Incumbents are competent to work independently in designing, developing, testing, implementing, and maintaining software systems and programs. Activities include analyzing information business requirements, recommending technology solutions, preparing automated system specifications, designing logic flow diagrams, screens, file structures, reports, forms and menus, performing quality assurance testing, and developing system documentation. Information Systems Analysts may supervise journey-level, technical or clerical staff. <br> <br> Information Systems Analyst differs from the Information Systems Specialist – Technical Support Analyst series in that incumbents specialize in, and spend a majority of their time working on, business applications systems analysis, design, and coding, with emphasis on more complex design and development activities; whereas Information Systems Specialists and Technical Support Analysts perform more general system support activities, which may include less complex systems and programming duties requiring less than 50% of their time. <br> <br> Information Systems Analyst is further distinguished from the next higher-level class of Information Systems Manager in that the latter is responsible for all of the data processing activities of a smaller department or for a major data processing section in a larger department.</p>
